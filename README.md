## Usage

To get started with the Panda, include the pet-panda script in your own JavaScript file and
spawn a new Panda in your chosen container:

```js
const Panda = require('pet-panda');

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    new Panda(document.body);
});
```

This will automatically include the needed styling to render the Panda and its Bamboo. The world the
Panda lives in will expand to fill the container that you give it, with the Panda exploring along
the bottom edge and the Bamboo slowly growing the full height of the world.
